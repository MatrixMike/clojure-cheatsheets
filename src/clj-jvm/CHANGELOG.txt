Minor clojure-cheatsheet-generator.clj script updates so it would run
without errors or warnings with Clojure 1.3.0.

Removals:

replicate, because DEPRECATED.
throw-if since it is declared private in clojure.core.  It was in 1.2
as well, but does it really belong in the cheatsheet?


Additions of things new in Clojure 1.3.0:

find-keyword to Other/Keywords
realized? to Using a Seq/Check for forced evaluation
every-pred and some-fn to Functions/Create
with-redefs and with-redefs-fn to Macros/Scope
clojure.repl/pst to Java Interoperation/Exceptions
unchecked-{add,dec,divide,inc,multiply,negate,remainder,subtract}-int to Numbers/Unchecked.  Space is a bit tight in that column to also include the long versions.
nthrest to Seq in, Seq out/Tail-items
clojure.data/diff to Misc/Compare
clojure.java.javadoc/javadoc to Documentation/clojure.repl (I know, it is not really in clojure.repl -- space is getting tight in that column)
clojure.pprint/pprint and print-table to Printing/Print to *out*


Additions of things that existed before Clojure 1.3.0:

compare to several places that seem appropriate:
    Seq in, Seq out/Rearrange, after sort-by
    Numbers/Compare
    Strings/Use
    Misc/Compare
flatten to Seq in, Seq out/'Change'
fnil to Functions/Create
instance? to Misc/Test


Moved:

doc and find-doc to Documentation/clojure.repl, since they moved from
clojure.core in 1.2.x to clojure.repl in 1.3.0.

Changes in cheatsheet version 2.0 from the cheatsheet version
published at http://clojure.org/cheatsheet as of Sep 5, 2011:

Additions:

Collections/Sets: sorted-set-by
Macros/Branch: case

Removals:

Removed contains? from Collections/Collections/Content tests, but
remains in Collections/Maps.  Its appearance in the former category is
potentially misleading as to its behavior.  Suggested by Stuart
Sierra.

Removed Transients/Change and Transients/Iteration categories, since
those functions did not work on transients.  All of the functions that
were there also appear elsewhere in more appropriate categories of the
cheatsheet.  Renamed Transients/Use to Transients/Change.

Removed nthrest and rfirst, which had no links to any documentation.
I believe they existed in a version of Clojure before 1.2, but were
removed by version 1.2 or earlier.

Minor:

HTML uses < > = ! instead of codes like %3C %3E etc.

Some reordering of lists of functions referring to types like byte,
short, int, long.
